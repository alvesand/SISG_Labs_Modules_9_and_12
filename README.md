# **R Labs for Modules 9 and 12 (SISG)**

This repository stores the R scripts for the modeules 9 (Quantitative Genetics) and 12 (Mixed Models in Quantitative Genetics) of the 27th Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics (SISG).

# **About the R labs**

The R scripts are divided according to the Module (9 or 12), feel free to follow along all scripts and try to understand every piece of code that you are running. 
**Discousure:** The scripts come with **no** warranty and are not free of potential bugs. Feel free to communicate us any potential issue. 

## Module 9 - Quantitative Genetics 

* **SISG_M9_Lab1:** This script illustrates how the pictures in pages 43 and 44 from IntroQG-seattle-2022-Lecture01_0 can be obtained. Those plots depict the additive and dominance variance in function of the allele frequencies for a single locus. 

* **SISG_M9_Lab2:** This script illustrates how to compute the additive relationship matrix (A) using different R packages.
